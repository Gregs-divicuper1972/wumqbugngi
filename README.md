I just stumbled out of the theater after seeing Heart Eyes... and I'm not sure what I walked into. It's like when you get your hair done and the stylist calls it a bold statement but you’re looking in the mirror thinking you've turned into something resembling a poodle with a bad attitude. Not all bad though—something about the chaotic charm of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 actually glued me to my seat, even if my head was screaming for a nap. 

If I’m being honest, I went in mostly because I needed an escape from my day of dye disasters (note to self: never mix chunky highlights with unrealistic Pinterest expectations). So there I was, popcorn in hand, ready to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into my brain cells hoping for something light. Instead, it feels like they threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at this screenplay. Was it a rom-com? Thriller? A weird avant-garde dance recital? Possibly all of those? Especially the dance part, because some characters moved like they had ants in their pants.

> There’s this character Penny, right? She walks around with this look in her eyes like she’s one unpaid bill away from snapping. You know the one—it’s the same look I give a client who insists on immortalizing their 90s bangs. Half the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, I was trying to figure out if I liked her or if I was just hypnotized by her stress-induced charisma. Her quest for love was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a cat stuck between two hedges, utterly confusing and yet strangely captivating. I mean, when does a person keep walking into emotional traps expecting a different result and not just decide to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   of their own life implode from a safe distance?

Then there’s the cinematography. Oh my holiday tinsel, it was something else. At one point, the color scheme felt like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 got dipped into a cosmic fruit punch. It’s definitely a choice and sometimes felt like a hair dye job gone wrong—bold, somewhat neon, but hard to ignore. I can see some aspiring directors pulling out their notebooks already to scribble “Moody Pink-Orange Filter - Must Have!” All I could think was, what a waste of perfectly good pixels.

```python
def emotion_swirl(heart, eyes):
    if heart == mixed and eyes == wide:
        return emotional kaleidoscope
        
print(emotion_swirl(mixed, wide))
```

And there was this ending, oh boy. Like taking a scissor, snipping the plot thread and hoping it unravels into something meaningful. Sort of like my bangs after a curious toddler finds them, snip snip. But that's the unpredictability of life isn't it — mostly annoying, kinda adorable? So yeah, if you're in for a kaleidoscope of feels and a bit of a head-spin sans the hangover, maybe give Heart Eyes a whirl, or you know, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it with half an eye while multitasking other life choices. Alright, time for some sleep therapy... where's my pillow?
